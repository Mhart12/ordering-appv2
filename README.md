# ordering-appv2
Final Project for LiftOff LaunchCode program (written in Android Studio)

The purpose of this final project is to successfully build an inventory, mobile app that can be used by my current managers to place plant orders that also record accurate inventory count. It will have features that allow the user to create new orders, read, edit or update saved orders, and delete older ones that no longer serve a purpose. 
Providing real-time inventory tools, so the user only has to pull up their phone to complete work orders instead of having to rush back to their desk, was one of their key interests when I asked to build this on their behalf. This will be a time saver and a more efficient way of conducting business at the local plant nursery I currently work at.
For future versions, I would like to see it expand to our other locations as well. And maybe even separating the app out to different departments within the stores, not just having it for the greenhouse. 

Features:
1. User login: Only certain people will be able to use this app, mainly management. A profile page will not be needed, but I would like several people from different stores to be able to use the app at once.
2. CRUD: I want the user to be able to create, edit, save, and delete orders from a provided list on the home screen.  Each order needs to be able to have multiple plant request on it, not just one type of plant request per order.
3. Database: When the orders have been sent, I want the order to reflect up-to-date amounts in the database. For example, when an order for 200 Red Jester Poinsettias is sent, 200 Red Jester’s need to be subtracted from inventory, leaving the most accurate numbers still in stock. When something is out, it needs to say, ‘Unable to fulfill order’ or something of that nature.
